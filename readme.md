# Bloomberg API Quickstart for Developers

A basic demonstration of simple request / response and subscriptions using the Bloomberg Desktop API.

## Notes

* You need to be logged into a Bloomberg terminal in order to be authorized to use the API services.
* This solution was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, but the source files can be used in a new project created in other versions of Microsoft Visual Studio.
* You need to add a reference to the Bloomberg API .NET assembly which is:

```
NoAdmin_DesktopAPI_SDK\API\APIv3\DotnetAPI\v3.8.9.2\bin\Bloomberglp.Blpapi.dll
```
